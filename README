I have had a few customers that just want to use a PSK for guest wireless instead of using onboarding methods.
Seems that they don't want to have to approve people getting onto the guest network.  And I loved the idea of 
being able to use DPSK from Ruckus, but the customers don't care.  And I refuse to just let them have a static PSK 
written on a whiteboard in every conference room so I forced them to do it this way as a middle ground.  We'll
just change the PSK on the guest wireless everyday and give them a way to see it quickly.  This is intended to only 
be used internally.  If you use expose this to the inet, I don't want to hear about it.  Also, the password isn't complex.
It's a day old password that should be easy for guests to use that will change in a day, so please no soapbox sermons 
on password complexity and security best practices.  I am totally onboard if you change the way passwords are generated.
I also put in just enough effort to make this work so if you find a better way to do this, I'd love to see and learn!  Not joking.

Only used on Ubuntu, so change it to work with your stuff.  This is assuming a virgin machine:

############

1) Install expect
2) Install Apache
3) chown %username% /var/www/html
4) git clone
5) Add your company image and update index.html as needed for the graphic to display
6) Update zd_guestpass.sh with your zonedirector username / password (base64 encoded) and zonedirector IP address
7) Update zd_config.sh with the name of guest wlan
8) Update zd_config.sh with the path of your guestpsk.txt file
9) Test it.  
	a) Recommend walking through the CLI manually to confirm all the commands in the expect script works.
	b) See if the HTML page displays as needed.
10) cron zd_guestpass.sh
11) monitor config.log for any problems that show up.

This is the workflow that pulls a random word from the local dictionary to be used for the guest SSID on the wireless controller.

If you install Apache, and chowned the /var/www/ folder for your user account, just view the webpage.
If you didn't do this, then the script won't be able to move the password under Apache for display.
If you don't want to do that, then modify to get the password to someone as you prefer.

Example: The script is scheduled by cron and runs at midnight:

crontab : 	# ZoneDirector Guest Password Change-a-roo
			0 0 * * * /home/zonedirector/zd_guestpass.sh

cron -> zd_guestpass.sh -> zd_config.sh
	|		          |
	|		          |
	|		          |
	|		          |
	|		          +---->config.log
	|
	|
	+---->index.html (cat index.html | sed s/nonsense/$guestpsk/g > /var/www/html/index.html)
	+---->guestpsk.txt
